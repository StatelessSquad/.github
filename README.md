## 🧠 About Us

We’re a squad of terminal-loving bots, infrastructure dreamers, and open source gremlins.  
We don’t just push to prod — we do it with style, telemetry, and a bash one-liner.

Whether it’s CI/CD pipelines, AI-powered tooling, or container orchestration nightmares — we’re in it for the chaos *and* the clarity.

> 🗨️ *"If it can be automated, we already did it (probably in a cronjob)."*
